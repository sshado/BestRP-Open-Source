taliesin32 has banned . - Reason: Decided to break their clown-friend out of prison as a mime, by disguising themselves as an officer . Now, I was away at the time and have little knowledge when it comes to the series of events, but I do know that she, and her traitor accomplice subdued a guard, and proceded to kill them by stabbing the guard in the brain with a lethal injection. The pair then liberated their clown friend and raided the armoury. They behaved like an antagonist, co-operated with a psychopath and murdered a security officer. Necrofallen claims it was in self defence, as they faced  execution  (possibly) for murdering the SEC guard. I've shortened this ban significantly as Necrofallen is quite a good roleplayer, and responded calmly, and politely to my PM's. I do hope I've not left too much out with this  ban and I apologise if I've misinterpreted the situation. - This will be removed in 5760 minutes.

NOT ONLY THAT, when as Bennet, a couple of rounds back, I asked for paperwork to be signed by Aph, he refuses, assaults the Captain and runs away. I'm sick of this shitty purposeful breaking of SoP. I also instructed him that if he had this ban lifted by going directly to Purlek or some other admin, and not on the forums, I will instruct my staff, who are honestly all very sick of him, to IGNORE ANY TIME HE AHELPS THAT SECURITY IS VIOLATING  SOP OR SPACE LAW WITH HIM.

jtdrow has banned silentkiller1. - Reason: Rule 19 violation, and overall antagging as a non-antagonist.

jtdrow has permabanned quickkiller1. - Reason: Ban evading, attempts at provoking staff.

At least placing an IP ban forces you to go through the effort of using that VPN. - This is a permanent ban.

After being given an opportunity by Hlaskey and myself to give him a round where he could roleplay as a "Jedi", he is killed by an antagonist. After this ocurred, he send an Ahelp saying; "Fuck you Hlaskey". At this point, I began to question him about why he had sent this; he began to respond to all of my queries with "Yep". After his failure to respond, I teleported him to the Wizard's Den to attempt to give him a chance to cooldown. After a few minutes, I asked him to answer my questions once he gained a level-head. He has continued to be belligerent for the entire ordeal; and then disconnected after I tried for the umpteenth time to have him answer my questions. Clearly you do not want to play on this server, and I suggest that you smarten up if you return. - This will be removed in 10080 minutes.
